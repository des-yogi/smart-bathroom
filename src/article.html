                <p>Master bathroom is the place where you can personalize most of the things, add an expanded palette of materials and features, and luxury amenities. Based on trends in new housing, a well-appointed master bath is often a smart long-term investment.</p>

                <h2>Here are some key considerations to include in your planning process for primary bathroom:</h2>

                <p>Size and layout of the Master bathroom. A 6x8-foot space works for two adults if a tub, toilet, and single vanity are all you need; allow about 6x10 feet if a double vanity is a part of the plan. Any additional features increase the amount of space required as does an oversize tub. Categorization improves a master bath, as it does a family bath. In this case, however, keeping the toilet alone to make privacy in the tub or shower.</p>

                <img src="img/article-inner-1.jpg" alt="" width="828" height="620" loading="lazy">

                <p>Because it partners with the bedroom, the master bathroom also is often allied with other functional areas. The classic example is an adjacent walk-in closet or, if there’s room, a separate dressing area. Locating a dressing area between the bedroom and bath provides a measure of sound insulation, although it also risks creating an obstacle course between the bedroom and bathroom.</p>

                <h3>Popular Features for primary bathroom:</h3>

                <ul>
                  <li>Master bathroom is the ideal place to work in. It’s hard enough to get kids to wash their hands after using the bathroom, so it’s doubtful that a bidet in the family bath would get much use. This is a good reason to install it in a master bathroom and you may have a good fit.</li>
                  <li>A vast new world of interesting and artistic fixtures awaits you. When planning a master bathroom remodel consider installing one of the following features: whirlpool bath, body jets, steam unit, heated floor, towel warmer and bidet seat. Multiple -head showers allow two people to shower as comfortably as one. And vessel sinks, which look like ceramic bowls set on a counter, provide a seemingly unlimited choice of shapes, sizes, and colors of the modern vanity.</li>
                  <li>Finally, bathroom renovation requires a detailed lightening plan that will do much to enhance the soothing aura of your master bathroom. Put general lighting on dimmers so you can create a mood or provide softer light at night. Consider task lighting for common activities, such as grooming, shaving, and even reading. A comfortable primary bathroom is a haven, a place in which to retreat and recharge.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>How to properly organize a large space, make the interior of a large master bathroom attractive and functional? What materials, plumbing, furniture and decor to use in a primary bathroom?</p>

                <h4>Master bathroom remodel ideas:</h4>
                <img src="img/article-inner-2.jpg" alt="" width="828" height="620" loading="lazy">

                <ul>
                  <li>A primary bathroom is a symbol of luxury and comfort, so it is rarely found in ordinary apartments. A bathroom is not only expensive, but also a very convenient solution. Here a person can relax after work and take care of himself. <br>Also, it is easy to place a full-size bathtub for comfort. If possible, when planning main bathroom renovation, you can install both a bathtub and a separate shower system.</li>
                  <li>If you have only a primary bathroom, it also serves as a family bathroom that has to be convenient for all families including children. You can install two sinks so that children can calmly brush their teeth and wash their faces without disturbing each other. A primary bathroom can be decorated in various styles, adding furniture, decorations and accessories. All this is impossible to do in a small bathroom, since there is simply no room for this.  In a primary bathroom, you can think of a storage system that will allow you to place a lot of things without taking up space in the hallway or dressing room.</li>
                  <li>To prevent the room from seeming empty and looking luxurious, it is important to adhere to the principle of symmetry in design. This is when the interior has a center of composition, and the objects on the sides seem to mirror each other.</li>
                  <li>When planning bathroom remodel in a primary bathroom, you can install two washbasins. This looks impressive and allows several family members to use them at the same time.</li>
                  <li>Two separate mirrors also visually enlarge the space and make it attractive.</li>
                  <li>It is better not to place the toilet opposite the door, but to the side and divide it with a glass if possible.</li>
                  <li>A special attribute in the design of a large bathroom is a freestanding bathtub. If space allows, it should not be placed close to the wall. Visually, such a bathtub should be the main object in the space, it does not need to be closed with a screen or glass.</li>
                  <li>Another, more expensive, but interesting option is to make a jacuzzi instead of a bathtub. If you need to make a separate shower and bathtub, they should be designed as two independent zones. You can highlight the zones with lighting or a podium.</li>
                  <li>Instead of a regular shower head, a flush mount rain shower head will look interesting in a primary bathroom.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Master bathroom renovation is a complex but interesting process.</h4>

                <p>Choosing a style, light and color palette for a master bathroom remodel is a key to success.</p>
                <p>Primary bathrooms are most often made in a classic or neoclassical style. This way, the bathroom acquires the features of a luxurious design. If the bathroom needs to be made more spacious and without unnecessary details, then a modern style and minimalism are suitable.</p>
                <p>In the classic version, the finishing is often done in light colors, and in minimalism - in dark ones.</p>

                <img src="img/article-inner-1.jpg" alt="" width="828" height="620" loading="lazy">

                <p>Large bathrooms need good and high-quality lighting. Without uniform light in the main bathroom, there will be dark corners and shadows on the walls. Don’t forget to discuss your electrical needs before bathroom remodel starts. You can highlight certain areas, for example, a shower, bathtub or washbasin. This can be done with pendant, wall or table lamps.</p>
                <p>It is also important to provide soft, subdued light. This can be floor, wall and furniture lighting, or lamps in which you can adjust the light intensity with a dimmer.</p>

                <p><strong>Furniture and accessories.</strong></p>

                <p>Unlike standard bathrooms, the primary bathroom has space to realize all the most ambitious design ideas. You can add decor and exquisite furniture to the interior. Greenery looks good in the interior of large bathrooms. Flowers and plants can be placed on the washbasin countertop or on open shelves. The main thing is to choose such specimens that can exist in places of high humidity.</p>

                <h3>The following 11 affordable tricks that will make your luxury bathrooms ideas will surely inspire you to make your bathroom space more luxurious.</h3>

                <img src="img/article-inner-3.jpg" alt="" width="465" height="620" loading="lazy">

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Solid-surface countertop.</strong> Solid-surfacing countertop, cast from an acrylic resin or from natural stone combined with resins and pigments. Commonly they use mineral dust from marble, some of them recyclable and have a matte, non-porous surface. They are require little maintenance and are more durable than laminate or quartz. Scratches, abrasions, and minor burns can be repaired with fine- grade sandpaper. Sinks are integrated directly into the countertop, so there are no seams to clean.</li>
                  <li><strong>Radiant-Heat Flooring system.</strong> Bare feet on cold stone and tile floors can be uncomfortable, but radiant heating systems can be comfortable and warm. Radiant energy works when the warmth from the radiant system comes in contact with a cooler surface, such as a porcelain tile floor. The heat is also transferred to the air that comes in contact with the floor.</li>
                  <li><strong>Shower system.</strong> A growing trend in showers is to install both rain head and handheld shower for convenience and a more luxurious look. Rain heads can be wall or ceiling mounted. And a hand shower can be hooked directly on a wall or on a sliding bar. The 2-way shower system costs only 30%-35% higher than 1-way but makes your shower experience much more comfortable. In addition, since a hand shower has a stretchy hose, you can reach water from each angle of your shower. Another new feature is the digital shower control panel. This system allows you to switch from the hand to overhead system with one button click. It also has a stylish and elegant design.</li>
                </ul>

                <img src="img/article-inner-3.jpg" alt="" width="465" height="620" loading="lazy">

                <p><strong>Lighting strips under vanity & in the shower.</strong> With new lightning technologies it’s so easy to create the design that would make you feel unique and special. Also, it’s a fact that the right lighting setting works like a therapy and increases serotonin level. New trend is to add LED stripes under wall hung vanities and in shower niches and shower bases.</p>

                <img src="img/article-inner-3.jpg" alt="" width="465" height="620" loading="lazy">

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Luxury faucets.</strong> As you shop for faucets, you’ll find options more traditional with hot and cold handles and modern one-handle designs that have different shapes and even crystals integrated in handles. Faucet prices start at $150 for the most basic models and run as high as $1,200 or more. Solid brass die-cast parts are a sign of quality, but they often come with steep price tags, anywhere from $290 to $1,400 or more. The cheapest faucets are made of plastic and don’t last longer. Although appealing in price, their longevity is questionable. You’ll also need to make sure the faucet set you select is the proper size and design to fit your sink. Most vanity sinks come with holes drilled in their rims to accommodate standard faucets and plumbing.</li>
                  <li><strong>Body jets and Steam showers.</strong> Take a trip to a spa without leaving your home. It’s easy to do when you have a shower stall that doubles as a steam bath or body jets. Body jets are installed against one or more walls of the shower stall and are equipped with water jets arranged vertically from knee to neck level. Like a whirlpool tub, the water jets pump out and recirculate quantities of water for a powerful massage. To make your shower steam-ready: Equip your shower stall with a top and a door that seals tightly. Usually, it’s a custom-made shower door. Install vapor barrier on the ceiling and wall framing to prevent moisture, which causes wood root, from reaching the studs and joists. Include a steam generator to your shower. A steam generates eats water from your water system using an electric 220-volt heating element. The size of the generator you’ll need depends on the size of your room and the material covering the shower walls. The steam generator supplier will help you determine the best size.</li>
                  <li><strong>Storage planning.</strong> The key to keeping a bath tidy is to make putting something away as easy as leaving it on the counter. Plan storage that makes it simple to stay organized and, once your bathroom is complete, you’ll save time, space, and money. A smart master bathroom plan storage should also help simplify your life. Use designated space and proximity. Plan a specific place for each thing. You'll have an easier time accessing items and getting into the habit of putting things away if you plan a spot for each item. Whenever possible store items right where they are used. For example, the best place for a hair dryer is in an appliance garage where you can keep it plugged in and ready to use. Use those 7 strategies to organize your storage batter:</li>
                </ul>

                <ol>
                  <li>Keep it simple</li>
                  <li>Prioritize placement</li>
                  <li>Make it comfortable</li>
                  <li>Put wasted space to work</li>
                  <li>Add seating</li>
                  <li>Create a spot for dirty clothes</li>
                  <li>Commit to a clutter-free bath</li>
                </ol>
